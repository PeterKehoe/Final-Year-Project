# Final-Year-Project
Intermediate devices, Profile dependant, Path Allocation in a Software Defined Network

1.1 Motivation
Software defined networks are a relatively new technology, and like many technologies,
it  can  take  a  considerable  amount  of  time  before  it  becomes  widely  adopted  and  im-
plemented However with large organisations coming out in support of SDNs, it is safe
to say that SDNs are going to become the norm for large to medium networks in the
near future.  With this in mind, the main motivation behind this project is to develop
a module for an openflow controller which will help integrate equipment from multiple
vendors  by  creating  device  profiles  to  help  the  controller  make  better  decisions  when
installing forwarding rules.  This is an important consideration as while large businesses
and organisations will use devices from the same vendor,  all of the same model,  with
the same software and hardware capabilities, the same can not be said for all networks.
Some networks will grow and evolve in stages, devices are often bought and integrated
into the network as needed, so a dedicated decision making module that will factor in
these  devices  is  a  potential  advantage  for  an  expanding  network  and  for  current  net-
working migrating to a SDN. A side goal of this project is to immerse myself in the area
of SDN as an emerging technology it was not a topic that gets covered in great details
during the four years of our undergraduate, and also to demonstrate that SDN is a topic
that undergraduates are more than capable of undertaking.
